# MegaMan mini-project

This was an assignment to showcase instantiation and deconstruction of entities, and separation of classes (I think).

It's a fairly simple "game" with only up/down movement, a forward walking pattern, and shooting. 
The game works by having the player walk toward the right where the enemy walks toward the player. The enemy is determined by random in a short list. Once the enemy is hit by 10 bullets, the enemy is defeated and a new enemy is created off screen. After defeating all enemies, the game is won and will close.

## Controls

Up/Down: Move player up/down. <br>
Right: Walk to the right. Enemy will appear from edge. <br>
Space: Shoot bullet.
